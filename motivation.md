### Everything will be ok with time.

#### Yes, but time need to pass and is important to not lose the mind in between. Watch a movie!

Movies helped me in my deepest period of my life. I was depressed, no social life, bullying everyday at school and no love was destroyng me slowly.
But in the afternoon, after a a day plenty of insults, with my laptop I usually watched 2/3 movies. Everyday, in the summer also all day.
But there, in that "metaverse"/alternative life/bubble, I was safe. My only source of good vibes/life.

Slowly my life came back, I started to live it and I stop to watch movies every day.
Today I watch movies only few times a month, I started creating short movies with my small camera and I'm a freelancer photographer.
Movies helped me to tollerate that life. I don't know if I would have been able to overcome that life without movies.

So now I want to give back what I received (free), helping others to find the movies they like (free).
#### So "which movie next" is a free project for everyone and I hope that can help others.

### Enjoy your next movie!
